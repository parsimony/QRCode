QRCode
======

This module is established to provide a QR Code block.

## Description

This QR Code module is based on Google Chart Tools (https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/infographics/docs/qr_codes).

As we know (https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/terms), Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate those Google Chart Tools versions and features identified at http://developers.google.com/chart/chart-api-list without these changes until April 20, 2015.

Beyond this aspect of depreciation, this module can generate pages in blocks QR Code types. 
This can be particularly useful to refer the user to other content or to a mobile site.
